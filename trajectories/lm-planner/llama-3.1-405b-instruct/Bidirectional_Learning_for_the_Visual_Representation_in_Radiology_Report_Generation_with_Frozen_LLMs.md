The paper "Bidirectional Learning for the Visual Representation in Radiology Report Generation with Frozen LLMs" proposes a novel bidirectional learning framework for radiology report generation. The framework integrates both vision-to-text and text-to-vision information to enhance visual representation learning. The authors require that the visual representation aid the LLM in generating reports that closely match the ground truth and that the visual representation be maximally generated by the LLM when provided with the ground truth report.

The paper presents several ablation studies to assess the contribution of each module in the framework, including vision-to-text (V2T), text-to-vision (T2V), and image reconstruction (Img Rec). The results show that the full model, combining V2T, T2V, and Img Rec, achieves the best results.

However, there are two potential missing ablation studies that could further strengthen the paper:

1. Ablating the text encoder: The paper introduces a new text encoder to enable the frozen LLM to perform text-to-vision generation. However, it would be interesting to see how the model performs without this text encoder or with a different text encoder architecture.
2. Ablating the LLM: The paper uses a frozen LLM, but it would be interesting to see how the model performs with a different LLM or without an LLM at all. This could help to understand the contribution of the LLM to the overall performance of the model.

These additional ablation studies could provide further insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed framework and help to identify areas for future improvement.
