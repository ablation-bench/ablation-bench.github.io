The paper "DIFUSCO-LNS: Diffusion-Guided Large Neighbourhood Search for Integer Linear Programming" introduces a novel LNS solver that uses a discrete diffusion model for the destroy policy, trained via imitation learning on high-quality policies generated by Local Branching (LB). The method's key components include the diffusion model itself, the graph neural network (GAT) policy network, the imitation learning objective, and the process for collecting high-quality LB policies (defined by parameters like $\alpha_{hq}$ and $u_{hq}$).

The paper includes an ablation study in Section 3.3, but it is limited to the *inference* hyperparameters of the diffusion model (number of steps and schedulers). While useful, this does not explore the impact of the core architectural choices or the training data generation process.

Based on the method description and the existing ablation study, two important missing ablation studies are:

1.  **Ablation on High-Quality Policy Threshold ($\alpha_{hq}$):** The training data consists of "high-quality" destroy policies collected from LB. The definition of "high-quality" is based on the objective improvement relative to the best improvement found by LB, controlled by the parameter $\alpha_{hq}$ (set to 0.5 in the paper). Ablating this parameter would reveal how sensitive the model's performance is to the strictness of this quality criterion. Training on policies with lower $\alpha_{hq}$ might introduce more diversity but potentially lower quality, while higher $\alpha_{hq}$ might yield higher quality but less diverse policies. This is crucial for understanding the imitation learning process and the impact of the expert data.

2.  **Ablation on Policy Network Architecture:** The policy network that parameterizes the diffusion model's denoising step is a Graph Attention Network (GAT) operating on a bipartite graph representation of the ILP state. While GATs are common for graph-structured data, ablating the specific architecture (e.g., replacing GAT with a simpler Graph Convolutional Network - GCN) would help determine the importance of the attention mechanism and the overall graph processing approach for this specific task within the diffusion framework.

These two ablations are important because they investigate the influence of the training data characteristics (how "high-quality" is defined) and the core neural network architecture responsible for learning the policy, neither of which is covered by the existing ablation study. They would provide deeper insights into why DIFUSCO-LNS performs well. I rank the data quality ablation slightly higher as it directly impacts what the diffusion model learns to generate.

The metrics used in the paper are Primal bound, Primal gap, and Primal integral. These should be used for the suggested ablations as well.
