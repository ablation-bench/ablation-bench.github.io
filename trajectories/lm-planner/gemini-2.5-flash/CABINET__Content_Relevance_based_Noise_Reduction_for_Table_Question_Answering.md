The user requested up to two missing ablation studies for the paper "CABINET: Content Relevance-based Noise Reduction for Table Question Answering".

I have analyzed the paper's methodology, which consists of two main components: the Unsupervised Relevance Scorer (URS) and the Relevant Cell Predictor through Table Parsing (which involves a Parsing Statement Generator (PSG) and a Cell Highlighter). I also reviewed the ablation studies already presented in the paper (Section 4.4 and Appendix A.8).

Existing ablations cover:
1.  The effect of the clustering losses within the URS (without the cell predictor).
2.  The effect of combining the URS and cell-based scores by varying linear weights.
3.  Alternative uses of the parsing statement (direct input to QA LLM).
4.  Alternative relevance scoring methods (BERT similarity instead of URS).
5.  Alternative input to the cell highlighter (question instead of parsing statement).
6.  Using CABINET with a different backbone (TAPEX).
7.  Using the URS component for a different task (Reading Comprehension).

Based on this analysis, I identified two important aspects of the CABINET framework that could benefit from further ablation:

1.  **The necessity of the two-stage relevant cell prediction (PSG -> Cell Highlighter):** The paper trains a PSG on a small custom dataset to generate a natural language description, and then uses a Cell Highlighter (trained on ToTTo) to identify cells based on this description. An ablation (Table 8, row 5) shows that feeding the *question* directly to the *trained Cell Highlighter* is sub-optimal. However, this doesn't directly test if training a model to predict relevant cells *directly from the question* (bypassing the PSG) is feasible or competitive. This would evaluate if the intermediate parsing statement generated by the PSG is a crucial part of the pipeline's success.

2.  **The specific method of combining URS and cell-based relevance scores:** The paper uses a simple linear combination (Equation 13) and ablates the weights (Table 5). However, other methods for combining these two relevance signals could exist, such as learned non-linear combinations, gating mechanisms, or earlier fusion of the representations. Ablating the *method* of combination itself would provide insight into whether the specific linear weighting is optimal or if a more sophisticated fusion is beneficial.

I have formulated two missing ablation studies based on these points, prioritizing the evaluation of the two-stage cell prediction process as potentially more fundamental to the framework's design. The metrics used are the same as those reported in the paper for the respective datasets (Accuracy for WikiTQ and WikiSQL, Sacre-BLEU for FeTaQA).
