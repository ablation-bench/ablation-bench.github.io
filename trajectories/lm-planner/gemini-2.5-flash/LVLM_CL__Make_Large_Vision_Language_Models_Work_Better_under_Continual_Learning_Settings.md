The paper "LVLM-CL: Make Large Vision-Language Models Work Better under Continual Learning Settings" proposes a novel approach for continual learning in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). The method, LVLM-CL, consists of several key components: a task-specific text feature based prompt (which seems to correspond to the Q_TS feature), a learnable module for input images (the trainable projector W for V_TS), a memory bank, and a concentration learning module for task-invariant features (Q_TI).

The paper includes an ablation study in Section 5.3. This section analyzes the impact of the memory bank size (Table 4) and the hyper-parameter alpha (Table 5) used in the concentration learning module update. It also briefly discusses the effect of task order.

However, the ablation study does not cover all the core components of the proposed LVLM-CL method. Specifically, it does not ablate:
1.  The contribution of the task-invariant (TI) features (Q_TI) generated by the Concentration Learning Module itself. While the alpha parameter of this module is tuned, the necessity and effectiveness of the TI features are not directly tested by removing them.
2.  The role of the trainable projector W used for processing visual features (V_TS). The paper states this module is trainable to make features more distinguishable, but its impact compared to a fixed or removed projection is not evaluated.

Based on the method description and Figure 2, the Concentration Learning Module, which generates the task-invariant features (Q_TI), appears to be a central component designed specifically for the continual learning setting to retain knowledge across tasks. Ablating this component would directly assess the contribution of the task-invariant features to mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving performance in the CL setting. This makes it the most important missing ablation.

The trainable visual projector W is also a specific design choice in LVLM-CL's architecture for processing visual inputs in a task-specific manner (as it's part of generating V_TS, which is task-specific). Ablating its trainability or presence would reveal its importance.

Therefore, I will suggest two missing ablation studies: one removing the task-invariant features (ablating the Concentration Learning Module's output) and one ablating the trainable visual projector. I will prioritize the ablation of the task-invariant features as the most critical missing study. The metrics used in the paper's ablation section are GQA and POPE scores, so I will use these.
