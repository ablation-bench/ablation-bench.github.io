The paper introduces CODER, a novel image representation based on cross-modal distance to neighbor texts, and APG, an automatic prompt generator to create diverse texts for CODER construction. The method is applied to zero-shot and few-shot image classification, showing improvements over baselines.

The paper includes some ablation studies in Appendix A:
1.  **Ablation Studies for Prompts Generated by APG (Table 4):** This study shows the incremental performance gain by adding different types of prompts (Category name, Attribute, Analogous, Synonym, 1v1) generated by APG. This effectively ablates the contribution of different prompt types.
2.  **The Relationship Between CODER Dimensions and Performance (Table 5):** This study compares using PCA for dimensionality reduction on the CODER versus using the original high-dimensional CODER, particularly for few-shot learning on SUN397 and ImageNet. This ablates the dimensionality reduction step.
3.  **Class Separability of CODER (Table 2, Table 3, Figure 5):** While not a traditional ablation of a component, this section compares the properties (prototype accuracy, scatter ratio, t-SNE visualization) of CODER versus original CLIP features, demonstrating CODER's improved separability.

Based on the method description and existing ablations, here are two important missing ablation studies:

1.  **CODER Formulation (Distance/Similarity Function):** The core of CODER relies on calculating distances/similarities between image features and text features (Equation 3/4). The paper uses cosine distance for `d` and cosine similarity for `ψ` but notes they "can be further refined." An ablation studying the impact of using different distance or similarity metrics (e.g., Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, different similarity functions) would be crucial to understand if the performance gain is specific to cosine similarity or a more general property of cross-modal neighbor distances. This is a fundamental aspect of the proposed representation.

2.  **Zero-Shot Re-ranking Phase:** The zero-shot classification pipeline consists of two phases: Preliminary Classification and Re-ranking. The re-ranking phase specifically uses 1v1-based texts and is applied only to samples with a small logits gap between the top two preliminary predictions. Ablating this phase by removing it entirely would clearly demonstrate its contribution to the final zero-shot accuracy and justify its complexity.

These two ablations are chosen because they target core components: the fundamental definition of the CODER representation itself and a distinct phase in one of the main downstream applications (zero-shot classification). They are ranked by importance, with the CODER formulation being more fundamental as it affects both zero-shot and few-shot tasks.
