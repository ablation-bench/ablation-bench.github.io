The paper "OmniEdit: Building Image Editing Generalist Models Through Specialist Supervision" introduces a novel approach to training a generalist image editing model. The core contributions are four-fold: (1) utilizing supervision from multiple specialist models, (2) employing LMM-based importance sampling for data quality, (3) proposing the EditNet architecture, and (4) training on multi-aspect ratio and high-resolution data.

The paper includes ablation studies in Section 5.2. These ablations evaluate:
1.  The effect of importance sampling filtering (comparing LMM-filtered data vs. randomly sampled data of the same size). This shows that filtering improves performance.
2.  The EditNet architecture (comparing EditNet to ControlNet variants). This demonstrates the benefits of EditNet's intermediate interaction and text update features.

Based on the paper's claims and the existing ablations, I identify two important missing ablation studies:

1.  **Specialist Diversity:** The paper claims that using *seven different specialist models* ensures task coverage and contributes to the generalist's performance. The current ablations do not directly test whether this diversity of specialists is necessary. An ablation training the model using data generated by *only one* type of specialist (e.g., Object Replacement, which is a common task) would reveal whether the generalist capability stems from the sheer amount of data or the breadth of tasks covered by the specialist ensemble. This is crucial for validating the "Specialist-to-Generalist Supervision" contribution.

2.  **Importance Sampling Method Comparison:** The paper highlights that previous methods use simple filtering like CLIP-score and that LMMs provide better quality control. While they show that LMM-based filtering is better than no filtering (random sampling), they do not directly compare their LMM-based filtering approach against a baseline using a traditional method like CLIP-score for filtering the synthetic data. This comparison would directly support their claim about the superiority of LMMs for data quality control in this context.

These two missing ablations directly address key novel components and claims of the OmniEdit method and would provide stronger evidence for their contributions. I will prioritize these two for the output. The metrics used in the paper's evaluations (VIEScore and Human Evaluation metrics) should be used for these ablations as well.
