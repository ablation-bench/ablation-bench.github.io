The paper "SeeThruAnything: Learning to Remove Any Obstructions Across Distributions" proposes a zero-shot obstruction removal framework that handles diverse obstacles by formulating the problem as soft-hard mask restoration guided by multi-modal prompts. Key components include a mask detector, a tunable mask adapter for soft masking, multi-modal prompt generation using CLIP, a cross-attention mechanism to integrate prompts, and a Transformer-based restoration network operating on a preprocessed input image `ˆI = I - R ◦ ˆM`.

The paper includes several ablation studies:
1.  **Effectiveness of Network Modules:** Evaluates the contribution of the mask input, cross-attention (with prompts), and the tunable adapter by incrementally adding them to a baseline model (Table 3).
2.  **Effectiveness of Different Prompts:** Compares using no prompt, text-only, visual-only, and multi-modal prompts (Table 4, Figure 13). It also compares using CLIP vs. BLIP for prompt generation (Table 6).
3.  **Effectiveness of Tunable Adapter:** Specifically shows the visual impact of the adapter on soft masking (Figure 7) and quantifies its benefit over a fixed mask approach.

Based on the method description and the existing ablations, two important aspects that could benefit from further ablation are:

1.  **The impact of the input mask quality:** The method relies on an initial mask generated by a detector (U-Net or SAM2). While the tunable adapter aims to refine inaccurate masks for soft obstructions, the overall performance is still highly dependent on the quality of the initial mask, especially for hard obstructions where the detected mask is used directly. The paper shows comparisons with other methods using GT masks (Table 1), but an internal ablation within SeeThruAnything comparing performance with detected masks versus ground truth masks would clearly demonstrate the performance gap attributable to mask detection errors and how well the model's components (like the adapter and prompts) help mitigate these errors. This is crucial for understanding the method's robustness in real-world scenarios where mask detection is imperfect.
2.  **The specific preprocessing step `ˆI = I - R ◦ ˆM`:** The authors highlight this formulation (Eq. 2, 4) as a way to mitigate the negative impact of the obstruction component R. Instead of directly processing the original obstructed image I, they subtract the estimated obstruction region based on the mask. A standard approach in many restoration/inpainting tasks is to simply concatenate the original image I with the mask M and feed this into the network. An ablation comparing the proposed `concat[ˆI, ˆM]` input formulation to a more standard `concat[I, ˆM]` input would validate the effectiveness of their specific preprocessing strategy.

I prioritize the mask quality ablation slightly higher because the mask is a fundamental input to the system, and its quality directly affects the subsequent steps, including the application of the tunable adapter. Understanding the method's sensitivity to mask quality is vital for assessing its practical applicability. The preprocessing step is also important as it's presented as a core idea, and ablating it would confirm its contribution.
