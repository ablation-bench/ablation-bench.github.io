The paper "Leveraging Cross-Modal Neighbor Representation for Improved CLIP Classification" presents a novel approach to improve the performance of CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) models by leveraging cross-modal neighbor representation. The authors propose a method called CODER (CrOss-moDal nEighbor Representation), which constructs an image representation based on the distance structure between images and their neighbor texts in the CLIP feature space. The key idea is to view text features as precise neighbors of image features in the CLIP space and use this neighbor relationship to build a better image representation.

The authors also introduce an Auto Prompt Generator (APG) to autonomously produce high-quality text prompts for constructing CODER. The APG generates five types of text samples, including category name-based texts, attribute-based texts, analogous-based texts, synonym-based texts, and 1v1-based texts.

The paper presents extensive experiments on various datasets, including ImageNet, CUB200, EuroSAT, and others, to demonstrate the effectiveness of CODER in zero-shot and few-shot image classification tasks. The results show that CODER consistently outperforms the original CLIP model and other state-of-the-art methods.

To further analyze the paper, we suggest two missing ablation studies:

1. **Ablation study on the importance of different prompt types**: The paper introduces five types of text prompts generated by APG. However, it would be interesting to investigate the importance of each prompt type and how they contribute to the overall performance of CODER. This ablation study could involve removing or replacing each prompt type and evaluating the impact on the model's performance.
2. **Ablation study on the effect of CODER dimensionality**: The paper mentions that the high-dimensional nature of CODER features can pose challenges for dense sampling of neighboring samples. The authors perform dimension reduction using PCA, but it would be interesting to investigate the effect of different dimensionality reduction methods or techniques on the model's performance. This ablation study could involve comparing the performance of CODER with different dimensionality reduction methods or techniques.

These ablation studies would provide further insights into the workings of CODER and help to identify areas for improvement.
