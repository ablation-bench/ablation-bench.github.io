The paper "Explaining black box text modules in natural language with language models" presents a method called Summarize and Score (SASC) for generating natural language explanations of text modules. The SASC method uses a pre-trained language model to summarize the top ngrams that elicit the largest response from the text module, and then evaluates each candidate explanation by generating synthetic text based on the explanation and testing the response of the text module to the text.

The paper presents several ablation studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the SASC method. However, there are some missing ablation studies that could provide further insights into the method's performance.

One potential ablation study is to investigate the effect of using different pre-trained language models on the performance of the SASC method. The paper uses GPT-3 as the helper LLM, but it would be interesting to see how other language models, such as BERT or RoBERTa, affect the results.

Another potential ablation study is to examine the impact of the number of candidate explanations generated by the SASC method on its performance. The paper generates 5 candidate explanations, but it would be useful to see how increasing or decreasing this number affects the results.

Additionally, it would be interesting to investigate the effect of using different metrics to evaluate the explanations generated by the SASC method. The paper uses accuracy and BERT-score, but other metrics, such as ROUGE-score or METEOR-score, could provide additional insights into the method's performance.
