The paper "DEP-RL: Embodied Exploration for Reinforcement Learning in Overactuated and Musculoskeletal Systems" presents a novel approach to exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) for complex systems with many degrees of freedom, such as musculoskeletal systems. The authors propose a method called Differential Extrinsic Plasticity (DEP) that uses a self-organizing process to generate exploration noise that is correlated across actions and time. The DEP method is integrated with a standard RL algorithm, MPO, to create a new algorithm called DEP-MPO.

The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of DEP-MPO in several challenging tasks, including reaching and locomotion tasks with up to 120 muscles. The results show that DEP-MPO outperforms other exploration methods, including those that use uncorrelated noise or no exploration at all.

One potential limitation of the paper is that it does not provide a thorough analysis of the hyperparameters used in the DEP-MPO algorithm. The authors mention that they performed extensive hyperparameter optimization for the ostrich-run task, but they do not provide details on the specific hyperparameters used or how they were optimized.

Another potential limitation is that the paper does not provide a clear explanation of how the DEP method works in high-dimensional systems. The authors provide a simplified example of how DEP works in a one-dimensional system, but it is not clear how this translates to more complex systems.

To address these limitations, two potential ablation studies could be performed:

1. Ablation study 1: Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis

This study would involve varying the hyperparameters used in the DEP-MPO algorithm and measuring the impact on performance. This would help to identify which hyperparameters are most important for the algorithm's success and how sensitive the algorithm is to changes in these hyperparameters.

2. Ablation study 2: Analysis of DEP in high-dimensional systems

This study would involve analyzing how the DEP method works in high-dimensional systems, such as those with many muscles or joints. This could involve visualizing the exploration noise generated by DEP and examining how it changes over time. This would help to provide a better understanding of how DEP works in complex systems and how it can be used to improve exploration in RL.
