The paper "Roadside Monocular 3D Detection via 2D-Detection Prompting" presents a novel approach to 3D object detection from monocular images. The authors propose a method that leverages a well-trained 2D detector to improve the training of a 3D detector. The 2D detector is used to generate prompts, which are then used to guide the 3D detector. The authors demonstrate that their method, called BEVPrompt, achieves state-of-the-art results on two benchmark datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I noticed that the authors did not conduct ablation studies on two important aspects of their method. Firstly, they did not investigate the effect of using different 2D detectors on the performance of the 3D detector. This is an important study as the choice of 2D detector may have a significant impact on the overall performance of the system. Secondly, they did not study the effect of using different prompt encoding methods on the performance of the 3D detector. The authors used a simple multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to encode the prompts, but other encoding methods may lead to better performance.

To address these limitations, I suggest two additional ablation studies. The first study should investigate the effect of using different 2D detectors on the performance of the 3D detector. This can be done by training the 3D detector with prompts generated by different 2D detectors and evaluating their performance on the benchmark datasets. The second study should investigate the effect of using different prompt encoding methods on the performance of the 3D detector. This can be done by training the 3D detector with prompts encoded using different methods, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and evaluating their performance on the benchmark datasets.
