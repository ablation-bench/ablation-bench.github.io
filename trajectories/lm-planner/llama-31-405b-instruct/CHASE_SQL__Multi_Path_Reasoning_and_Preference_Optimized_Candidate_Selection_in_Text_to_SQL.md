The paper presents CHASE-SQL, a novel framework for Text-to-SQL tasks that leverages multi-agent modeling and test-time compute for improved candidate generation and selection. The framework uses LLMs to generate diverse SQL candidates with a divide-and-conquer approach, chain-of-thought reasoning, and instance-aware synthetic example generation. A selection agent ranks candidates via pairwise comparisons using a fine-tuned binary selection LLM, offering robust performance.

The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed methodologies, including ablation studies on the importance of the selection agent and each candidate generation method. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving state-of-the-art execution accuracy on the BIRD Text-to-SQL benchmark test set.

However, the paper lacks ablation studies on the impact of the LSH for value retrieval and the query fixer on the overall performance of the framework. Additionally, the paper does not investigate the effect of varying the number of candidates generated by each method on the performance of the selection agent.

To address these limitations, we suggest two missing ablation studies:

1. Ablation study on the impact of LSH for value retrieval: This study would investigate the effect of removing the LSH for value retrieval on the overall performance of the framework. This would help to understand the importance of this component in achieving high-quality performance.
2. Ablation study on the impact of varying the number of candidates: This study would investigate the effect of varying the number of candidates generated by each method on the performance of the selection agent. This would help to understand the optimal number of candidates required for achieving high-quality performance.

These ablation studies would provide valuable insights into the importance of each component of the CHASE-SQL framework and help to identify areas for further improvement.
