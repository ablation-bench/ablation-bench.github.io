The paper "Enriching Knowledge Distillation with Intra-Class Contrastive Learning" proposes a new approach to knowledge distillation by incorporating intra-class contrastive learning into the teacher model. The authors argue that traditional knowledge distillation methods focus on aligning the student model with the teacher model, but neglect the learning objectives of the teacher model. They propose using intra-class contrastive learning to enrich the soft labels generated by the teacher model, which can improve the performance of the student model.

The authors also introduce a margin-based intra-class contrastive distillation approach, which integrates the concept of margin to improve the intra-class contrastive loss. They provide theoretical analysis and experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.

To further investigate the proposed method, I suggest two missing ablation studies:

1. **Effect of different margin values**: The authors introduce a margin threshold δ to filter out anchor samples that contribute to the intra-class contrastive loss. However, they do not provide a thorough analysis of how different margin values affect the performance of the student model. An ablation study on the effect of different margin values would provide valuable insights into the robustness of the proposed method.
2. **Comparison with other contrastive learning methods**: The authors use a specific form of contrastive learning, namely intra-class contrastive learning, to enrich the soft labels. However, there are other forms of contrastive learning, such as inter-class contrastive learning or self-supervised contrastive learning, that may also be effective. An ablation study comparing the proposed method with other contrastive learning methods would help to identify the most effective approach.

These ablation studies would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the proposed method and its limitations, and would help to identify potential areas for improvement.
