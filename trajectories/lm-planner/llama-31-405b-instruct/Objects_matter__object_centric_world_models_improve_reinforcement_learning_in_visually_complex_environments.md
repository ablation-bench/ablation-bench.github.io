The paper "Objects matter: object-centric world models improve reinforcement learning in visually complex environments" proposes an object-centric model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) pipeline, called OC-STORM, which integrates recent advances in computer vision to allow agents to focus on key decision-related elements. The method consists of four main steps: (1) annotating key objects related to rewards and goals with segmentation masks, (2) extracting object features using a pre-trained, frozen foundation vision model, (3) incorporating these object features with the raw observations to predict environmental dynamics, and (4) training the policy using imagined trajectories generated by this object-centric world model.

The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of OC-STORM on both Atari games and the visually complex game Hollow Knight, outperforming the baseline STORM on 18 out of 26 tasks in the Atari 100k benchmark and achieving the best-known sample efficiency on several Hollow Knight bosses.

To further assess the method, we suggest two missing ablation studies:

1. **Ablation A: Removing the object-centric representation**: This ablation study would involve removing the object-centric representation from the OC-STORM pipeline and training the model using only the raw observations. This would help to understand the contribution of the object-centric representation to the overall performance of the model.

2. **Ablation B: Replacing the pre-trained vision model with a randomly initialized model**: This ablation study would involve replacing the pre-trained vision model used in OC-STORM with a randomly initialized model. This would help to understand the importance of using a pre-trained vision model in the OC-STORM pipeline.

These ablation studies would provide further insights into the effectiveness of the OC-STORM pipeline and the importance of its individual components.
