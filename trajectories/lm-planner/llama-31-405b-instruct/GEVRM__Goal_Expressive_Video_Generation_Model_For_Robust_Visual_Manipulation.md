The paper "GEVRM: Goal-Expressive Video Generation Model For Robust Visual Manipulation" proposes a novel method for robust visual manipulation tasks using a goal-expressive video generation model. The method integrates the internal model control (IMC) principle to enhance the robustness of robot visual manipulation. The text-guided video generation model in GEVRM can generate highly expressive future visual planning goals. The model also evaluates perturbations by simulating responses, which are called internal embeddings and optimized through prototype contrastive learning.

The paper presents several ablation studies to evaluate the effectiveness of different components of the GEVRM model. However, there are some missing ablation studies that could provide further insights into the model's performance.

One potential missing ablation study is the evaluation of the impact of different video generation models on the performance of GEVRM. The paper uses a specific video generation model, but it would be interesting to see how other models affect the results.

Another potential missing ablation study is the evaluation of the impact of different prototype contrastive learning methods on the performance of GEVRM. The paper uses a specific prototype contrastive learning method, but it would be interesting to see how other methods affect the results.
