The paper presents NATVLM, an end-to-end embodied agent for object navigation based on fine-tuning an LVLM (Idefics 2) through imitation learning. The key components are:

1. The use of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) explanation traces during training to help the LVLM understand navigation rationale
2. Training on shortest paths generated by a BFS planner instead of human demonstrations
3. End-to-end perception and action prediction using the LVLM

Looking at the existing ablations in the paper:
- They ablated the CoT explanation traces (w/o ET)
- They tested different ways of comparing positions (w/ Gold Label, w/ Diff-EQ)
- They investigated hyperparameters like number of images and steps in history

Key missing ablations I identify:

1. The choice of LVLM backbone - They only used Idefics 2 but did not ablate different LVLM architectures which could significantly impact performance. This is important since the backbone choice is a major design decision.

2. The shortest path planning method - While they use BFS, they did not compare against other path planning algorithms like A* or RRT. The path planning method directly affects the quality of the training data.

I'll focus on these two as they represent core methodological choices that warrant investigation through ablation studies.
