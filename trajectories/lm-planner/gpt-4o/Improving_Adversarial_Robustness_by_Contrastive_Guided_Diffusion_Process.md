The paper "Improving Adversarial Robustness by Contrastive Guided Diffusion Process" introduces a novel approach to enhance adversarial robustness using synthetic data generated by a diffusion model guided by contrastive loss. The paper already includes several ablation studies focusing on the impact of different contrastive losses, the sensitivity of the hyperparameter λ, and data selection methods. However, there are still some critical components of the method that could benefit from further ablation studies to better understand their contributions to the overall performance.

1. **Contrastive Loss Variants**: The paper explores InfoNCE and hard negative mining (HNM) losses, but it does not investigate the impact of using other contrastive loss variants or combinations. An ablation study could explore the effect of using different contrastive loss functions or combining multiple contrastive losses to guide the diffusion process.

2. **Diffusion Model Variants**: The paper uses DDIM and DDPM as the base diffusion models. An ablation study could investigate the impact of using other diffusion model variants or modifications to the existing models, such as changing the number of diffusion steps or the noise schedule, to understand how these factors influence the quality of the generated data and the resulting adversarial robustness.

These ablation studies would provide insights into the flexibility and adaptability of the proposed method across different settings and configurations, potentially leading to further improvements in adversarial robustness.
