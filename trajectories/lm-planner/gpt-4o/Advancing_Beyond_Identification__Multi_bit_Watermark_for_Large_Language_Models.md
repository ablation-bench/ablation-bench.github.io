The paper "Advancing Beyond Identification: Multi-bit Watermark for Large Language Models" introduces a method for embedding traceable multi-bit information into text generated by language models. The method, called Multi-bit Watermark via Position Allocation (MPAC), builds on zero-bit watermarking techniques to embed and extract long messages without model access, while maintaining text quality and robustness against attacks.

The paper includes several ablation studies, such as the impact of different colorlist configurations and the robustness of the watermark under various attacks. However, there are some potential areas for further ablation studies that could provide additional insights into the method's performance.

One missing ablation study could focus on the impact of the pseudo-random function used for position allocation and vocabulary permutation. The choice of hashing scheme can significantly affect the robustness and quality of the watermark. An ablation study could explore the effects of different hashing schemes on the watermark's performance, particularly in terms of bit accuracy and text quality.

Another potential ablation study could investigate the effect of varying the bias term (δ) used to favor certain tokens during generation. The paper mentions that the bias term affects the success probability of message transmission, but a detailed ablation study could provide a clearer understanding of how different bias values impact the trade-off between watermark robustness and text quality.

These ablation studies would help to attribute the method's performance to its major components and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing the effectiveness of the multi-bit watermarking approach.
