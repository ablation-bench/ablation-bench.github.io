The paper introduces a novel method called CrOss-moDal nEighbor Representation (CODER) to enhance CLIP's performance in zero-shot and few-shot image classification tasks. The method leverages the cross-modal distance structure between images and their neighboring texts in CLIP's feature space. The Auto Prompt Generator (APG) is used to generate high-quality text prompts to improve the density of neighboring texts, which is crucial for constructing a high-quality CODER.

The existing ablation studies in the paper focus on the impact of different types of prompts generated by APG on model performance. The paper demonstrates that using class-specific prompts, analogous class-based texts, and synonym-based texts significantly improves performance compared to using fixed prompts provided by CLIP. Additionally, the paper explores the relationship between CODER dimensions and performance, showing that dimensionality reduction using PCA can be beneficial under certain conditions.

However, there are some missing ablation studies that could provide further insights into the method's performance. One important aspect to investigate is the impact of the Auto Prompt Generator (APG) itself. Since APG is a key component in generating the high-quality prompts that enhance CODER, understanding its contribution is crucial. Another potential ablation study could focus on the choice of distance metrics used in constructing CODER. The paper uses cosine distance and similarity, but exploring other distance metrics could reveal their impact on the method's effectiveness.

These missing ablation studies would help attribute the method's performance to its major components and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the method's strengths and limitations.
