The paper introduces a novel mechanism called "causal attention" to improve causal inference in machine learning models, particularly for reconstructing causal networks from time series data. The method focuses on identifying critical regions in the data where causal effects are more likely to manifest. The causal attention mechanism is designed to maximize a new metric called Attention-extended Transfer Entropy (AeTE), which is a generalization of the traditional transfer entropy metric. The paper includes experiments comparing the proposed method with several baselines, demonstrating its superior performance in identifying causal relationships in both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, it appears that the authors have not conducted ablation studies on certain key components of their method. Specifically, the causal attention mechanism and the Attention-extended Transfer Entropy (AeTE) are central to the proposed approach, yet the impact of these components has not been isolated and tested independently. Conducting ablation studies on these components would provide valuable insights into their individual contributions to the overall performance of the method.

1. Ablation of the causal attention mechanism: The causal attention mechanism is a critical component that guides the model to focus on regions of the time series where causal effects are likely to emerge. An ablation study that removes or modifies this mechanism would help determine its importance in the overall performance of the method.

2. Ablation of the Attention-extended Transfer Entropy (AeTE): The AeTE is a novel metric introduced in the paper to enhance the detection of causal effects. An ablation study that replaces AeTE with traditional transfer entropy or other metrics would help assess the added value of this new metric.

These ablation studies would help attribute the method's performance to its major components and provide a clearer understanding of the contributions of each component.
