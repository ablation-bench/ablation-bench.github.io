The paper "SADE: a Scene-text Autoregressive Diffusion Engine for Character Sequence Recognition" introduces a novel approach to generating synthetic data for OCR models using a diffusion model. The method involves generating image parts autoregressively to improve the generation of characters in novel positions. The paper includes several experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of SADE, including comparisons with original and synthetic data, and tests on both mock and real-world datasets.

The existing ablation studies in the paper focus on the impact of using synthetic data generated by SADE compared to original data, and the ability of SADE to generate characters in positions not seen during training. However, there are some potential areas for further ablation studies that could provide additional insights into the method's performance.

One missing ablation study could involve the character sequence conditioning mechanism. The paper mentions that the diffusion model is conditioned on character-level embeddings concatenated to form a sequence embedding. An ablation study could explore the impact of this conditioning mechanism by removing it or replacing it with alternative conditioning methods, such as using a simpler positional encoding or a different type of embedding.

Another potential ablation study could focus on the overlapping image parts strategy. The paper uses overlapping parts to ensure visual coherency and reduce artefacts. An ablation study could investigate the effect of varying the degree of overlap or removing the overlap entirely to assess its impact on the quality of generated images and the subsequent OCR performance.

These ablation studies would help to attribute the performance improvements to specific components of the SADE method and provide a deeper understanding of the design choices made in the paper.
