The paper "Reliable and Efficient Amortized Model-based Evaluation" introduces a model-based evaluation framework using Item Response Theory (IRT) to improve the reliability and efficiency of generative model evaluations. The paper highlights two main innovations: amortized calibration to reduce the cost of estimating item parameters and an item generator based on a large language model to automate question generation. The experiments demonstrate the approach's effectiveness across 25 NLP benchmarks and 184 language models.

The existing ablation studies in the paper focus on comparing traditional calibration methods with the proposed amortized calibration and evaluating the effectiveness of the item generator. However, there are potential missing ablations that could provide further insights into the method's components.

One missing ablation could involve the removal of the amortized calibration component to assess its impact on the overall evaluation framework. This would help determine the extent to which amortized calibration contributes to the efficiency and reliability of the evaluation process.

Another potential ablation could involve replacing the item generator with alternative question generation methods, such as manually curated questions or questions generated by simpler models. This would help evaluate the effectiveness of the item generator in creating a diverse and challenging item bank.

These ablations would provide a deeper understanding of the contributions of the amortized calibration and item generator components to the overall performance of the proposed evaluation framework.
