The paper "Guided Score Identity Distillation for Data-Free One-Step Text-to-Image Generation" introduces a novel method for distilling Stable Diffusion models without access to real training data. The method enhances Score identity Distillation (SiD) with Long and Short Classifier-Free Guidance (LSG). The paper includes several ablation studies focusing on different configurations of the guidance scales (κ values) and their impact on FID and CLIP scores. However, there are some potential areas where additional ablation studies could provide further insights into the method's performance.

Firstly, the paper does not explore the impact of different noise scheduling strategies on the distillation process. The method adapts SiD to the DDPM scheduling used by Stable Diffusion, but an ablation study comparing different noise schedules could reveal how sensitive the method is to this choice and whether alternative schedules could improve performance.

Secondly, the paper focuses on the use of synthetic images generated by the one-step generator for training. An ablation study that investigates the impact of using different types of synthetic data, such as varying the diversity or quality of the synthetic images, could provide insights into how the characteristics of the training data affect the distillation process.

These ablation studies could help attribute the method's performance to its major components and provide a deeper understanding of the factors influencing the effectiveness of the distillation process.
