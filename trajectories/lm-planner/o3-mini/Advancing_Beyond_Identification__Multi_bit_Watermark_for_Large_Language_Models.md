One missing ablation study we propose is to examine the effect of the vocabulary partitioning strategy. In MPAC, the watermarked text is generated by partitioning the permuted vocabulary into multiple colored lists in a random manner. However, the current paper only evaluates the approach with a random partitioning scheme. It would be insightful to replace this random strategy with alternative approaches – for example, using frequency-based or semantic clustering– and compare the watermark extraction performance, text quality, and detection metrics. This would help isolate the impact that the choice of partitioning has on both the robustness of the watermark and the naturalness of the generated text.
A second ablation study we propose involves testing the robustness of the watermark under summarization attacks. Although the paper evaluates paraphrasing and copy-paste corruption attacks, summarization is a practical post-processing operation that can significantly condense and rephrase content (thereby possibly removing or altering watermark signals). Investigating how the watermarked text fares when passed through different summarization systems (e.g. GPT-3.5, BART, T5) can provide further insights into the survivability of the embedded multi-bit watermark under common text transformations.
