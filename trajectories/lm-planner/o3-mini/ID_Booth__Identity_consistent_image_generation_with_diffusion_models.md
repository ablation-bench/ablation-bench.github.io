The first proposed ablation study focuses on the margin parameter (m) used in the triplet identity training objective. Although the paper introduces the triplet loss (Equation 8) with a non-negative margin, it does not analyze how different settings of this hyperparameter influence the trade-off between identity consistency and image diversity. Varying the margin value could reveal its sensitivity and its impact on both the quality and identity preservation of the generated images (measured by metrics such as FID, CMMD, CR-FIQA, and face recognition metrics like EER, FMR100, FMR1000, and FDR).

The second ablation study addresses the choice of negative samples in the triplet loss. In the current formulation, the method uses prior images generated by the pretrained model as negatives. However, alternative strategies—such as using randomly selected images from other identities in the training dataset or augmented variants of real images—may affect the separability of identities without adversely impacting synthesis quality. Evaluating different negative sample sources using similar quality and identity consistency metrics can help determine the best strategy for improving inter-identity separability and overall performance.
