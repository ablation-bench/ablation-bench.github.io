We propose to investigate two important components that have not been ablated in the paper. First, while the study uses BFS‐generated shortest path trajectories as expert demonstrations for imitation learning, it remains unclear how sensitive the performance is to the quality of these demonstration trajectories. In many imitation learning systems, the optimality and noise level of demonstration trajectories significantly affect the learned agent’s behavior. Therefore, an ablation study where the BFS trajectories are replaced with sub‐optimal or noisy trajectories (for example, trajectories with unnecessary detours or extra rotations) would help quantify how critical high-quality demonstrations are for NATVLM’s performance.
Second, while the paper demonstrates the benefit of including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) explanation traces in the training data, the source of these traces is fixed to manually collected templates. It would be important to gauge whether automatically generated explanation traces (e.g., generated by GPT-4 or another LLM) can replace the manually curated ones without sacrificing performance. This ablation would test the sensitivity of NATVLM to the quality and origin of the CoT explanations and assess the scalability of the method.
