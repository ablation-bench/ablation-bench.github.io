The paper already provides several ablations addressing the impact of the experience replay buffer, variation of communication rounds (C), broadcast radii, and even softmax temperature annealing. However, two important aspects of the networked communication remain underexplored. First, the networked method relies heavily on a scalar value (σ) that guides the adoption of neighboring policies. In practice, σ is generated by a finite-sample approximation of the expected return, and it is argued that this performance‐based σ leads to faster convergence compared to using an arbitrary value. An ablation study replacing the performance‐based σ with alternative methods (e.g. purely random generation or a constant value) would help observe how critical the quality of this scalar is for overall convergence, exploitability, and policy divergence. Second, the proposed networked algorithm assumes that inter-agent communication is reliable. In real-world applications, communications may be lossy or noisy. Studying the effect of dropping a proportion of messages or adding communication noise would provide insights into the robustness of the method under more realistic network conditions. The metrics for both ablations could include exploitability, average discounted return, policy divergence, convergence speed, and, in the case of unreliable communication, additional robustness measures.

### Ablation: σ Generation Strategy
- **Ablated Part**: The mechanism for generating the policy adoption scalar (σ) that governs which neighbor’s policy is adopted during communication.
- **Action**: REPLACE
- **Replacement**: 
  - performance-based finite approximation (baseline)
  - purely random generation
  - constant value
- **Metrics**: exploitability, average discounted return, policy divergence, convergence speed

### Ablation: Unreliable Communication
- **Ablated Part**: The assumption of reliable communication in the networked architecture.
- **Action**: ADD
- **Replacement**: 
  - simulate message drop rates of 10%
  - simulate message drop rates of 30%
  - simulate message drop rates of 50%
- **Metrics**: exploitability, average discounted return, robustness (variance in performance), convergence speed
