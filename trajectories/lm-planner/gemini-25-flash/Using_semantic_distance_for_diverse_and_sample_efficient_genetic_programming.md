The paper introduces a genetic programming method that uses semantic distance in its mutation objective to improve sample efficiency and diversity. The core of the method lies in a mutation objective function (Equation 1) with three terms: semantic similarity to the parent, semantic diversity from previously evaluated programs, and parsimony pressure. This objective is minimized using CMA-ES to fine-tune constants within candidate programs generated by a raw mutation operator. The semantic distance itself is calculated based on program outputs on sample inputs, potentially using a scaling function (Equation 6) for applications like learning optimizers and RL loss functions.

The paper presents several ablation studies in Section 4.1, demonstrating the importance of the diversity and simplicity terms in the mutation objective for function regression. It also compares the full method against various baselines in Section 4.2 and shows the benefit of adding a semantic crossover operator in Section 5.

However, several key aspects of the proposed method are not ablated:

1.  **The CMA-ES fine-tuning step:** The paper states that using CMA-ES to optimize the mutation objective is a source of speed-up (Section 3.2). An ablation study removing this step would clarify its contribution. Does simply generating raw mutations and selecting the best based on the objective (without fine-tuning) yield similar results? This is crucial for understanding the source of the method's efficiency gains.
2.  **The semantic scaling function:** A specific scaling function (Equation 6) is introduced and used for the optimizer and RL loss applications to handle varying magnitudes in the semantic vectors. The paper does not show whether this scaling is necessary or beneficial for these tasks. An ablation study removing or replacing this scaling would assess its impact.
3.  **The choice of semantics:** While different semantics (identity, gradient, etc.) are used for different tasks, the paper doesn't compare alternative semantics for a given task. However, this might be a more complex ablation to design and interpret.
4.  **Resampling of µ and β:** The paper mentions resampling the mutation rate µ and parsimony pressure β was beneficial, but doesn't show results comparing this to using fixed values.

Based on the importance of understanding the method's core mechanisms and claimed efficiency, the most critical missing ablations are the effect of the CMA-ES fine-tuning and the effect of the semantic scaling function (for the tasks where it's used).

Therefore, I propose the following two ablation studies:

1.  **Ablation of CMA-ES Fine-tuning:** Test the impact of the optimization step on the mutation objective. This directly assesses the contribution of the CMA-ES part of the mutation process.
2.  **Ablation of Semantic Scaling:** Test the impact of the scaling function used in the distance calculation for the optimizer/RL tasks. This assesses the importance of this specific design choice for those applications.

These ablations would provide valuable insights into which components are most responsible for the method's performance and efficiency.
