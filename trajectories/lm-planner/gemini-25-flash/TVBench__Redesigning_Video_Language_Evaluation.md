The paper "TVBench: Redesigning Video-Language Evaluation" identifies significant shortcomings in existing video-language benchmarks, particularly MVBench, highlighting spatial and textual biases that allow models to perform well without genuine temporal understanding. As a solution, the authors propose TVBench, designed with specific strategies to mitigate these biases and require temporal reasoning.

The core design principles of TVBench are outlined in Section 5.1:
1.  **Strategy 1: Define Temporally Hard Answer Candidates.** This involves selecting tasks that inherently require temporal understanding and crafting answer candidates that cannot be easily dismissed based on static information or simple heuristics. The paper contrasts this with MVBench's reliance on LLM-generated candidates which are often unrealistic or easily guessable.
2.  **Strategy 2: Define QA pairs that are not overly informative.** This focuses on using concise, task-specific templates to reduce textual bias and using balanced candidate sets where applicable, avoiding reliance on world knowledge.

The paper evaluates various models on TVBench (Table 4), demonstrating that text-only and image-only models perform near random, and performance drops significantly when videos are shuffled or reversed for stronger models. This evaluation shows that TVBench *is* effective at revealing temporal understanding (or lack thereof) in models.

However, the paper *does not* include ablation studies that directly test the impact of TVBench's *own* design principles. While they show TVBench is better than MVBench, they don't show *why* by varying elements of TVBench's construction. Specifically, ablating the strategies used to create TVBench's questions and answers would provide crucial evidence for the effectiveness of these design choices.

Two key missing ablations stand out:

1.  **Ablating the Temporally Hard Answer Candidates (Strategy 1):** The paper claims that defining hard, realistic candidates based on original annotations (instead of potentially biased LLM generation) is crucial. An ablation study could create a version of TVBench where answer candidates for certain tasks are generated using an LLM, potentially introducing the types of easily dismissible or biased options observed in MVBench. Comparing model performance on this "LLM-candidate TVBench" versus the original TVBench would quantify the impact of their candidate design strategy. This directly tests a core claim about TVBench's superiority.

2.  **Ablating the Balanced Candidate Sets (part of Strategy 2):** The paper mentions using balanced candidate sets for tasks like Action Count and Object Count to avoid textual bias from unbalanced distributions (like the '3' bias in MVBench's Action Count). An ablation could create a version of TVBench where the candidate distributions for these counting tasks are deliberately unbalanced. Evaluating models on this version would show how much performance gain is attributable solely to exploiting this statistical bias, thus validating the need for balanced sets.

Both ablations are important for validating the specific design choices of TVBench. Ablating the candidate generation strategy (Ablation 1) seems slightly more fundamental to the *temporal* challenge aspect, as easy candidates allow models to bypass temporal reasoning entirely. Ablating the balanced sets (Ablation 2) addresses a specific type of textual bias. Therefore, I rank Ablation 1 as slightly more important.

The relevant metric used throughout the paper for evaluating benchmark performance is Accuracy.

### TVBench w/ LLM Candidates
- **Ablated Part**: Temporally hard answer candidate generation strategy
- **Action**: REPLACE
- **Replacement**: 
  - Answer candidates generated by a large language model (e.g., GPT-4o, Llama 3) prompted to mimic biased generation
- **Metrics**: Accuracy

### TVBench w/ Unbalanced Counts
- **Ablated Part**: Balanced candidate sets for counting tasks (Action Count, Object Count)
- **Action**: REPLACE
- **Replacement**: 
  - Unbalanced candidate distributions for Action Count and Object Count tasks
- **Metrics**: Accuracy
