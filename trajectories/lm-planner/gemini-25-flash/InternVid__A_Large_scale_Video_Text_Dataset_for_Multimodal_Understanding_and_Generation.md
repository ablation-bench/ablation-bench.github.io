The paper "InternVid: A Large-scale Video-Text Dataset for Multimodal Understanding and Generation" introduces a new large-scale video-text dataset, InternVid, and a video-text representation learning model, ViCLIP, trained on this dataset. The core contributions lie in the scalable dataset construction method using multi-scale captioning powered by LLMs and the ViCLIP model trained with contrastive learning and video masking.

The paper includes several ablation studies:
1.  **Data Scale:** Evaluating ViCLIP performance on different sizes of the InternVid dataset (10M, 50M, 200M clips).
2.  **Data Filtering and Diversity Sampling:** Comparing performance on standard 10M subset vs. diversity-sampled (10M-DIV) and filtered (10M-FLT) subsets.
3.  **Captioning Method Comparison:** Comparing their multi-scale captioning approach against using captions generated by VideoChat.
4.  **Captioning Scale Comparison:** Ablating the contribution of coarse-level captions by comparing performance using fused coarse+fine captions vs. coarse-only captions (BLIP2 on middle frame).
5.  **Model Scale:** Comparing ViCLIP-Base vs. ViCLIP-Large.
6.  **Language Source Impact:** Comparing training on English vs. Chinese video subsets.

While these ablations cover important aspects, two significant components of the proposed method lack detailed ablation studies:

1.  **Video Masking in ViCLIP Training:** The paper mentions using video masking during pretraining for efficiency without compromising effectiveness. However, there is no experiment presented that directly compares training ViCLIP *with* masking against training *without* masking to quantify its impact on final performance across downstream tasks. This is a key part of their training strategy for efficiency, and validating its effect on effectiveness is crucial.
2.  **Contribution of Summarized Fine-Scale Captions:** The paper ablates fused captions vs. coarse-only captions, showing the benefit of the multi-scale approach over just the coarse scale. However, it does not explicitly ablate the contribution of the *summarized fine-scale captions* alone compared to the fused captions. While they state that raw frame-wise captions are unsuitable, comparing the fused approach (coarse + summarized fine) against using *only* the summarized fine-scale captions would isolate the specific value added by the coarse-scale captioning component when the fine-scale information is already processed into a summary.

Based on their importance to the core method (training strategy and data generation pipeline), I propose these two missing ablation studies. The video masking ablation is slightly more critical as it pertains directly to the model training efficiency and effectiveness claim.

The metrics used for evaluation should align with those reported in the paper for ViCLIP performance, primarily zero-shot and fine-tuned action recognition (Kinetics) and video retrieval (MSR-VTT, LSMDC, DiDeMo, MSVD, ANet).
